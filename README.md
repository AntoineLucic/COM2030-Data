- Rule of Law World Index (http://worldjusticeproject.org/rule-of-law-index)
> The World Justice Project (WJP) Rule of Law Index® provides original,  impartial data on how the rule of law is experienced by the general public in 102 countries around the globe. The WJP Rule of Law Index is the most comprehensive index of its kind and the only to rely solely on primary data. The Index’s scores are built from the assessments of local residents (1,000 respondents per country) and local legal experts, ensuring that the findings reflect the conditions experienced by the population, including marginalized sectors of society.

- Global Climate Change Impact (Index)
> The ND-GAIN Country Index, a project of the University of Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN), summarizes a country's vulnerability to climate change and other global challenges in combination with its readiness to improve resilience. It aims to help businesses and the public sector better prioritize investments for a more efficient response to the immediate global challenges ahead.
